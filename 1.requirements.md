# Accessibility Requirements for Recipe Dashboard  

**Website**: [Recipe Dashboard](https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/)  

**Objective**: Define accessibility requirements to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines and provide an inclusive user experience.  

---

## 1. General Accessibility Requirements  

1. The website must meet **WCAG 2.1 AA standards** for accessibility.  
2. All interactive elements must be operable by both mouse and keyboard.  
3. The website must be compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers.  

---

## 2. Specific Requirements  

### 2.1 Keyboard Navigation  

1. All interactive elements (buttons, links, forms, etc.) must be focusable and navigable using the **Tab** key.  
2. Interactive elements must be activated using standard keyboard inputs such as **Enter** or **Space**.  
3. The visual focus indicator must be clearly visible on all focusable elements.  

---

### 2.2 Color Contrast  

1. Text must have a contrast ratio of **4.5:1** against the background (for normal text) and **3:1** for large text.  
2. Non-text elements (e.g., buttons, borders) must meet a contrast ratio of **3:1** against the adjacent background.  
3. Links must be visually distinguishable through contrast, color, or additional styling.  

---

### 2.3 ARIA Roles and Landmarks  

1. Custom components (e.g., modals, dropdowns) must use appropriate **ARIA roles** (e.g., `role="dialog"`, `role="menu"`).  
2. ARIA landmarks (e.g., `role="main"`, `role="navigation"`) must be defined to structure the page content for assistive technologies.  
3. Components with ARIA roles must include required attributes (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-expanded`) where applicable.  

---

### 2.4 Image Alt Text  

1. All informative images must have descriptive `alt` attributes.  
2. Decorative images must use empty `alt=""` to ensure they are ignored by screen readers.  

---

### 2.5 Forms and Input Labels  

1. All form elements must have associated `<label>` tags or accessible labels (e.g., `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`).  
2. Placeholder text must not be used as a substitute for labels.  
3. Error messages must be clear, specific, and programmatically associated with the respective input fields.  

---

### 2.6 Links and Buttons  

1. All links and buttons must have a descriptive and meaningful label that indicates their purpose.  
2. Buttons and links must be styled to distinguish them from non-interactive elements visually.  

---

### 2.7 Screen Reader Compatibility  

1. The website must be fully accessible using popular screen readers, such as NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.  
2. All dynamic content (e.g., modals, pop-ups) must be announced to screen readers appropriately.  
3. Ensure no redundant or irrelevant content is announced by assistive technologies.  

---

### 2.8 Heading Structure  

1. The heading structure must be hierarchical, starting with `<h1>` and nesting subsequent headings logically.  
2. Each page must have a single `<h1>` element that describes the page's main purpose.  
3. Avoid skipping heading levels (e.g., jumping from `<h1>` to `<h3>` without an `<h2>`).  

---

## 3. Additional Requirements  

1. Dynamic components (e.g., modals, dropdowns) must maintain focus within the component until dismissed.  
2. Provide a "Skip to Content" link at the top of the page for improved keyboard navigation.  
3. Ensure no time-based content locks out users without a warning or an option to extend time.  

---

## 4. Compliance Tools and Testing  

1. Use tools such as **axe**, **WAVE**, or **Lighthouse** to identify common accessibility violations.  
2. Conduct manual testing with:  
   - NVDA or VoiceOver for screen reader compatibility.  
   - Keyboard-only navigation.  
   - Color contrast analysis tools.  
3. Validate the website against WCAG 2.1 AA standards using an accessibility checklist.
