# Accessibility Testing Project Plan  

**Project Name**: Accessibility Testing for Recipe Dashboard  

**Project Objective**: Ensure that the [Recipe Dashboard](https://broken-workshop.dequelabs.com/) complies with accessibility standards, providing an inclusive and usable experience for all users, including those with disabilities.  

---

## 1. Test Plan Overview  

This test plan outlines the approach, scope, and methodology for conducting manual accessibility testing on the Recipe Dashboard. The purpose is to identify accessibility barriers, assess compliance with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, and recommend improvements for usability and accessibility.  

---

## 2. Scope  

The accessibility testing will focus on evaluating the following aspects of the Recipe Dashboard:  
- Keyboard navigation  
- Color contrast  
- ARIA roles and landmarks  
- Image alt text  
- Forms and input labels  
- Links and buttons  
- Screen reader compatibility  
- Heading structure  

**Out of Scope**: Automation scripts or tools for accessibility testing are excluded.

## 3. Test Objectives  

1. Verify that the website is navigable using a keyboard only.  
2. Assess color contrast between text and background elements.  
3. Ensure ARIA roles and landmarks are used appropriately for better navigation and interaction.  
4. Validate the presence of descriptive alternative text for images.  
5. Confirm that forms and input fields have accessible labels.  
6. Check that links and buttons are identifiable and operable.  
7. Evaluate compatibility with screen readers.  
8. Examine the heading structure for logical and hierarchical organization.

## 4. Test Approach  

All tests will be conducted manually using the following tools and resources:  
- **Keyboard-only navigation**  
- **Screen reader tools** (NVDA on Windows)  
- **Browser Developer Tools** (for inspecting HTML elements and contrast check)  
- **WCAG 2.1 Guidelines** (as the reference standard)
