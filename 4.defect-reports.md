## Defect Report 3: ARIA Roles and Attributes  

**ID**: A11Y-003  
**Title**: Missing ARIA roles and attributes for dialog components.  
**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Accessibility  
**Environment**:  
- Device: Desktop, OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Chrome 131.0.6778.70 (64-bit) 

**Description**:  

Interactive elements like buttons should have a semantic role such as `button` that communicates their functionality to assistive technologies. Additionally, dialog components lack essential ARIA attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`.  

**Steps to Reproduce**:  

1. Navigate to the Recipe Dashboard website.  
2. Open a dialog window by clicking on a button "Cook Chocolate Cake".
3. Inspect the HTML structure of the dialog window.  
4. Close recipe dialog window.
5. Inspect the "Edit" button (dispayed on any recipe card) using browser developer tools.
6. Observe the role attribute of the button.  


**Expected Result**:  

The dialog should include ARIA roles and attributes for accessibility, such as `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-describedby`. Interactive elements like buttons should have a semantic role such as `button` that communicates their functionality to assistive technologies.  

**Actual Result**:  

The dialog lacks essential ARIA attributes, making it difficult for assistive technologies to interpret the content. The "Edit" button has `role="generic"`, which fails to provide semantic meaning or interactivity information to assistive technologies.  

**References**:

**Severity**: High  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Accessibility  
**Environment**:  
- Device: Desktop, OS: Windows 10
- Browser: Chrome 131.0.6778.70 (64-bit)  

**Description**:  

Several image elements on the Recipe Dashboard website do not have `alt` attributes, causing them to be inaccessible to screen readers.  

**Steps to Reproduce**:  

1. Navigate to the Recipe Dashboard website.  
2. Inspect the images on the page using browser developer tools.  
3. Verify the presence of `alt` attributes for each image.  

**Expected Result**:  

All images should have meaningful `alt` attributes or empty `alt=""` for decorative images.  

**Actual Result**:  

Multiple images lack `alt` attributes, rendering them inaccessible to screen reader users.  

**References**:  

- WCAG 2.1, Guideline 1.1.1 (Non-text Content)  

**Attachments**:
