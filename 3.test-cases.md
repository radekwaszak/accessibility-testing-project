# Accessibility Testing for Recipe Dashboard

## Test Cases

### 1. Keyboard Navigation Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-001
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and is using a keyboard.
- **Post-Conditions**: The website should be fully navigable with the keyboard.

2. Press `Tab` to navigate through interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields).
3. Press `Shift+Tab` to go backward through the interactive elements.
4. For each focusable element:
   - Verify that it receives focus (a visual indicator should appear, such as a border or highlight).
   - Verify that all focusable elements are reachable in a logical, left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.
5. Press `Enter` or `Space` on buttons or links and verify they perform the intended action.
6. If there are form fields, ensure that you can tab through all of them.

### 2. Color Contrast Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-002
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and a color contrast checker tool installed.
- **Post-Conditions**: Ensure all text meets WCAG contrast standards.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Use a color contrast checker tool, such as the **WAVE** browser extension or **Color Contrast Analyzer** (accessible in browser DevTools).
2. Check the contrast between text and background in the following areas:
   - Body text (normal size).
   - Headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.).
   - Links and buttons.
3. Ensure that the contrast ratio for normal text is at least **4.5:1**.
4. Ensure that the contrast ratio for large text (over 18px or bold 14px) is at least **3:1**.

#### **Expected Results**:

- All text should have sufficient contrast against its background (normal text: **4.5:1**, large text: **3:1**).

### 3. ARIA Roles and Landmarks Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-003
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and browser developer tools.
- **Post-Conditions**: All ARIA roles and landmarks are correctly applied.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Use browser developer tools (right-click -> Inspect or press `F12`) to inspect the page.
2. Check if landmarks (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`) are used appropriately.
3. Look for custom ARIA roles (e.g., `role="navigation"`, `role="banner"`, `role="main"`) and ensure they are applied correctly to semantic elements.
4. Verify that ARIA attributes (like `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) are used correctly for custom components like sliders or modals.
5. If there are interactive regions (like menus or buttons), ensure ARIA roles like `button`, `link`, and `menuitem` are used correctly.

#### **Expected Results**:

- ARIA roles are used correctly and enhance the accessibility of custom components.
- Landmarks are defined appropriately and help in navigation.

### 4. Image Alt Text Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-004
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and browser developer tools.
- **Post-Conditions**: All images should have appropriate `alt` text.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Inspect all `<img>` tags on the page.
2. Check that every image has a meaningful `alt` attribute:
   - Descriptive alt text for images that convey content or meaning.
   - An empty `alt=""` attribute for purely decorative images.
3. For icons or buttons that use images, check if the `alt` text describes the function (e.g., `alt="Close"`).

#### **Expected Results**:

- All content images have descriptive alt text.
- Decorative images have `alt=""` (empty alt attribute).

### 5. Forms and Input Labels Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-005
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and the page contains forms.
- **Post-Conditions**: All forms must be properly labeled.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Inspect the page for any form elements (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc.).
2. Check that every form input has an associated `<label>` element, and that the `for` attribute matches the inputâ€™s `id`.
3. If there are form fields that are grouped (e.g., radio buttons or checkboxes), ensure that the group has an appropriate `<legend>` or `<fieldset>` for context.
4. Check that error messages are associated with the corresponding form fields and that they are accessible (using `aria-live` or visible on the page).

#### **Expected Results**:

- All form fields have associated, correctly linked labels.
- Error messages are readable by screen readers.

### 6. Links and Buttons Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-006
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and the page contains links and buttons.
- **Post-Conditions**: All links and buttons must have descriptive and actionable text.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Inspect all links (`<a>`) and buttons (`<button>`) on the page.
2. Ensure that each link and button has meaningful text that describes its purpose (e.g., `Read more`, `Submit`, `Go to Home`).
3. Verify that no link or button is left empty (e.g., `<a href="#">` with no text).
4. For links that open new tabs or windows, ensure they provide a clear indication (e.g., `aria-label="Opens in a new window"`).

#### **Expected Results**:

- Links and buttons have meaningful, descriptive text.
- Links that open new tabs or windows are announced with appropriate labels.

### 7. Screen Reader Compatibility Test

- **Test Case ID**: TC-007
- **Severity**: High
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website and a screen reader is enabled (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).
- **Post-Conditions**: The website must be navigable and understandable with a screen reader.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Enable a screen reader:
   - For Windows: Use **NVDA** or **JAWS**.
   - For macOS: Use **VoiceOver** (Enable via `Cmd + F5`).
2. Navigate the site using the screen reader:
   - Use the `Tab` key to navigate between links and buttons.
   - Listen to the screen reader's announcements for headings, form fields, and links.
3. Ensure that content is read in a logical order, starting from the top of the page.
4. Check if all images, buttons, and form fields are announced with their `alt` text or labels.

#### **Expected Results**:

- Content is read in a logical order.
- All interactive elements are correctly announced by the screen reader.
- Images and form fields have appropriate alt text or labels.

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Accessibility
- **Automation**: Manual
- **Pre-Conditions**: User has access to the website.
- **Post-Conditions**: The page should have a clear and logical heading structure.

#### **Test Steps**:

1. Inspect the page to ensure there is only one `<h1>` (main heading).
2. Verify that headings follow a hierarchical order (`<h2>` below `<h1>`, `<h3>` below `<h2>`, etc.), with no skipped heading levels.
3. Ensure that headings are used for logical sections and not for styling purposes.

#### **Expected Results**:

- Headings are used in a logical order, with no skipped levels.
- The structure of the content is clear and easy to navigate using headings.
