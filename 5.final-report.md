## 4. Detailed Findings  

### 4.1 Keyboard Navigation (FAILED)  

**Issues**:  
- The "Edit" button is not accessible via keyboard inputs (Enter/Space).  

**WCAG Violation**:  
- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Ensure the "Edit" button has proper event listeners to handle Enter and Space keypresses.  

---

### 4.2 Color Contrast (FAILED)  

**Issues**:  
- Insufficient contrast for "Beginner" difficulty text (contrast ratio: 2.17).  

**WCAG Violation**:  
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)**: Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Adjust the color combination to meet the required contrast ratio.  

---

### 4.3 ARIA Roles and Landmarks (FAILED)  

**Issues**:  
- The "Edit" button has `role="generic"`, which fails to provide semantic meaning or interactivity information to assistive technologies. 
- Dialog components lack attributes such as `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`, and `aria-hidden`.  

**WCAG Violation**:  
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Ensure all user interface components have an accessible and appropriate name, role, and value.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Add appropriate ARIA roles to custom components.  
- Enhance dialog accessibility by adding ARIA attributes.  

---

### 4.4 Image Alt Text (FAILED)  

**Issues**:  
- Several images do not include `alt` attributes.  

**WCAG Violation**:  
- **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: Provide text alternatives for non-text content.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Add meaningful `alt` attributes to all informational images.  
- Use empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""`) for decorative images.  

---

### 4.5 Screen Reader Compatibility (FAILED)  

**Issues**:  
- NVDA does not announce any elements on the page.  

**WCAG Violation**:  
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.  

**Recommendation**:  
- Verify that all interactive and non-interactive elements are programmatically exposed to screen readers.  

---

### 4.6 Other Tests (PASSED)  

- **Forms and Input Labels**: All forms and input fields have accessible labels.  
- **Links and Buttons**: All links and buttons are recognizable and functional.  
- **Heading Structure**: Logical and hierarchical heading structure is observed.

## 5. Severity and Priority of Issues  

| **Issue**                    | **Severity** | **Priority** |  
|------------------------------|--------------|--------------|  
| Keyboard navigation failure   | High         | High         |  
| Insufficient color contrast   | Medium       | Medium       |  
| Missing ARIA roles/attributes | High         | High         |  
| Missing `alt` attributes      | High         | High         |  
| Screen reader incompatibility | Critical     | High         |  

---

## 6. Recommendations  

1. **Keyboard Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements respond to keyboard inputs.  
2. **Color Contrast**: Update color combinations to meet WCAG contrast requirements.  
3. **ARIA Roles**: Correct roles and attributes for better navigation and interaction.  
4. **Image Descriptions**: Provide descriptive alt text for images.  
5. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Test with NVDA and fix compatibility issues.  

---

## 7. Conclusion  
The Recipe Dashboard website has several critical accessibility issues that need immediate attention. Addressing these issues will improve usability and ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.  

**Next Steps**:  
- Prioritize fixes based on the severity of issues.  
- Retest after implementing fixes to verify compliance.
